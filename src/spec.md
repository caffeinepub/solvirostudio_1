# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a modern, clean, extra-long single-page SolviroStudio portfolio site for solar-company Meta Ads + Creative Design services, using the warm brand gradient and the uploaded logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page layout with 7 sections: Home, Portfolio, About Us, Services, Client Results, Testimonials, Contact Us.
- Implement a sticky top navigation with anchor scrolling and active-section highlighting while scrolling.
- Build the Hero section with the exact headline/subheadline, a “Get Started Now” CTA that scrolls to Contact Us, and a background gradient (#FFD233 → #FFA500 → #FF6A00).
- Apply the brand accent colors and consistent primary CTA gradient styling across the site; ensure each major section includes a visible CTA button.
- Add the About section with the exact provided text, a “Learn More” CTA, and an adjacent responsive illustration/image area.
- Add the Services section with exactly three named services, each with a 1–2 sentence description, plus an “Explore Services” CTA.
- Add the Portfolio section with 5–7 project cards including an ad design image, a campaign goal line, and results metrics, plus a “View Full Portfolio” CTA.
- Add the Client Results section with the exact intro sentence, a responsive grid for multiple results images/charts, and a “Get Your Results” CTA.
- Add the Testimonials section with the exact supporting text, 3–5 client quotes, and a CTA consistent with the sitewide pattern.
- Add the Contact Us section with the exact provided text, email display (solvirostudio@gmail.com), phone placeholder, and a contact form (name, email, optional phone, message) with validation and a clear success state.
- Implement a backend endpoint to store contact submissions (name, email, phone, message, timestamp) and connect the frontend form submission to it.
- Incorporate the uploaded SolviroStudio logo into the header (and optionally footer); logo click scrolls to the Home section.
- Apply a coherent professional theme (typography/spacing/cards/separators) using neutral backgrounds to keep the warm accents readable.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll through an extra-long SolviroStudio portfolio with sticky navigation, view services/portfolio/results/testimonials with consistent CTAs, and submit a validated contact form that confirms success; the header shows the SolviroStudio logo and brand gradient styling throughout.
