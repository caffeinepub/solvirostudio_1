  "summary": "Diff adds a reusable PortfolioProjectImage component with lazy loading and error fallback, and updates PortfolioSection to document/configure external (Pinterest) URLs in the portfolioProjects data. However, the diff summary is truncated and does not show the actual rendering of images/cards, so key acceptance criteria (using external URL at render-time and ensuring alt text contains project title) cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "When a Pinterest image URL is provided for a project, the card renders that URL in the image element instead of the local asset path.",
      "reason": "PortfolioSection.tsx shows comments and a data field (image) that can hold a Pinterest URL, and it imports PortfolioProjectImage, but the truncated diff does not show the JSX where the image component is rendered and which src is passed.",

      "requirement": "All portfolio images (local or Pinterest-hosted) include descriptive alt text that contains the project title.",
      "reason": "PortfolioProjectImage requires an alt prop, but the truncated PortfolioSection diff does not show the call site where alt is constructed, so it’s not verifiable that alt includes the project title for every card.",
